## What is Meaning of Words UI?

Semantic UI is a framework that allows for the use of natural language to mix and combine premade classes that should make your life easier when making a website. It is designed around the same concept of its name, semantics, which essentially means "The meaning of words and how they're related". It simply uses the class tag with a leading "ui", and then the following keywords will be used to help format the element. The formatting options it provides far exceed what you can normally do in raw html and css, so the complexity and neatness of the resulting web page is worth it to those who want a more professional looking website.

## How I Feel About Relation of Words to Eachother UI

I do not like Semantic UI. This has multiple reasons to it, but the main one is that I am not good with html and css in general. I do not understand how they react with one another and why centering a button is so hard. I am also unsure of when to use Semantic, since the problem largely revolves around my lack of ability to formulate questions around what I need, and what I don't know I need. I can definitely see the purpose of it, since if provides a library of professional looking elements, however, my inability to use html effectively prevents me from really experiencing it. Unless I improve significantly in my web programming skills, I do not see myself using Semantic UI at all. However, despite my personal inablitiy to utilize Semantic, I do believe it is a valuable tool for website building. I like to think it's like a specialized piece of equipment for an already specialized field. You can only really understand the basics and are proficient with them, can you begin to learn the more advanced things. It might take a few more hours of W3 schools, though if I'm doing that, I might as well learn Bootstrap since I'm there and its free.
