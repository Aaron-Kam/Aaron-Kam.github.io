My current opinion of Javascript is that I like it a lot more than Java and C. In fact It kind of feels like a mix of Python and C, meaning a C with a lot of the quality of life improvements that make it more pythonic. This is kind of a surface level comparrison though, as I feel like I havent used javascript enough. That being said, what can I can definitely say is that Java is nothing like Javascript. They are about as related as a Car and Carpet when I use it. In fact, I feel like its name was chosen to be malicious or deceiving in some way, or so negligently awful that it can be interpreted as malicious. They should change the name.

Naming aside, I do enjoy Javascript. Seeing as I have only formally learned C and Java it feels like a gigantic step up from those two. Seeing the light of Python does fill me with some despair of what could have been, but they were made for different reasons so I can't hold that against Javascript. I did learn a few things from the module, mostly syntax, but also the more obscure operators. The thing I'm most excited for is its use in conjunction with HTML and CSS, so I'm looking forward to what it can do in a browser.

The athletic WODs are... different than what I'm used to. I'm not a huge fan of doing fast, and timed programming exercises with a language I'm not completely comfortable with. This problem will become less and less existent when I learn Javascript more, but I feel like the WODs that appear before we've actuallly learned the language should be weighed less, just as a way to ease us into the language.
