In my sophomore year of university I took my first computer science course, and for my final project we had to write a program that met 3 criteria: it had to contain an array list, had inheritance, and had to run. My team took these requirements and finished our project in very little time, so we decided to improve on it. The resulting project basically turned into a custom level from Metal Gear.

Controlling Not-Solid Snake is fairly straightforward. Movement uses WASD, and space bar shoots, though only upwards,getting shot does damage. The enviornment could be interacted with to an extent as well: trucks can be entered, ammo can be picked up, and your character will be called on the codex. The whole thing was topped off with a tank boss battle in which you shoot at the tank and it shoots back. All in all, it was a fairly smooth process, as we all had our own classes that we wrote independently with specifications of what kinds of methods needed what kinds of inputs and what kind of return values. Most of all though, it did teach me how to program in a group, especially in the ways to not step on eachother's toes
